• Designed and implemented image captioning system, combining CNN-based visual feature extraction with an LSTM-based sequence decoder, to automatically generate relevant captions for wide range of images.
• Preprocessed and structured datasets, developed training pipelines in Python, and utilized PyTorch for model development, tuning hyperparameters to optimize accuracy and evaluating performance through BLEU score.
• Acquired in-depth knowledge of deep learning architectures, gaining practical exposure to convolutional networks, and sequential language generation, while strengthening proficiency with NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
